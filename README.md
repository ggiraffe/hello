### hello

It is a simple project for *ggiraffe* to practise Git & GitHub.

A web page is created to display a random greeting to the guest when the page is loaded. Guest name is passed by querystring. The visiting history of the guests are stored in cookies. The greeting is selected according to how frequent the guest has visited the page.

**Usage**

Load index.html in web browser:
```
~/hello/index.html?guestA
```

A javascript alert will be displayed:
```
It's nice to meet you! guestA
```
